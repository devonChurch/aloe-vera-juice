## What ðŸ‘‹

An experiment to augment an application by both **Business Skew** and **Language** while leveraging a single codebase.

## Why ðŸ¤”

When scaling out an application to facilitate new audience opportunities, reusability is essential to experiment, pivot, and deliver features quickly.

## How ðŸ’¡

We use a traditional I18n pattern to abstract content from the application UI and Business Logic. We can then create a new layer that, in addition to Language, allows the differentiation of **Business Skew** too.

We use an enrichment pattern so that a Base **Language** _(like English)_ can be enriched by Business Skew specific requirements. This keeps duplication to a minimum and encourages **Business Skew** content to focus on their unique properties only.

### Example:

Load the School sub-domain and request the German content skew.

Load the Home sub-domain and request the English content skew.

## Demo ðŸ“º

### Language
Users can change their application **Language** on the fly while retaining their original content, pluralization text, and UI selections.

### Business Skew
Changing the application subdomain pulls in the **Business Skew** content for the current **Language** route.
